"""
Optional module for collecting index metadata from external sources.

Currently, all necessary metadata is sourced from the static configuration file:
src/config/indices.json

This module is kept as a placeholder for potential future enhancements, such as:
- Verifying metadata against free external APIs (if suitable ones are found).
- Implementing web scraping for specific metadata fields (use with caution due to brittleness).
- Integrating with other potential free data sources for index information.

NOTE: As of now, this module is NOT used in the main pipeline (src/main.py).
